REQUIREMENTS:

Create a password strength widget that could be used in multiple forms. The widget should fulfill the following requirements:
(1) Follow best practices for determining password strength.
(2) Allow any number of strength ranges (ex. "weak", "good", "excellent", etc...) to be defined for each password field.
(3) Be independent of page's HTML structure so the functionality can be used for any number of different login forms.

DISCUSSION:

The definitive research on calculating password strength has been conducted by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and documented in their "Electronic Authentication Guideline" (http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-63-1/SP-800-63-1.pdf). The NIST's recommendations for password strength calculations are located in Appendix A of the aforementioned document. The NIST defines a password's strength in terms of "entropy". Entropy is simply how random the characters in the password are. A password composed of more random characters will have a higher entropy value. For requirement #1 I used the entropy calculations defined in the Electronic Authentication Guideline for determining a password's entropy.

 The Electronic Authentication Guideline provides a detailed description of how to calculate entropy, but for the sake of brevity, here a simplified explanation on how it works:

    (1) Determine how many character sets the password is in. For example "test1234-=" contains three character sets: lowercase characters ("test"), numeric ("1234"), and special characters ("-=").
    (2) Calculate initial entropy value based on size of the character sets the password is in, the number of character sets the password is in, and the length of password.
    (3) Add bonus entropy for passwords that pass a dictionary test.

How much entropy does a "strong" or "weak" password have? That answer is subjective. For that reason, and to fulfill requirement #2, the password strength meter accepts a range of entropy values to define what constitutes weak or strong passwords.
